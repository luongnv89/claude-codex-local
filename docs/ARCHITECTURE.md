# Architecture

This document describes the system design of `claude-codex-local`.

## Overview

`claude-codex-local` is a **local backend bridge** that sits between the Claude Code / Codex CLI harness (the AI coding tool the user already knows) and a locally-running LLM server. It does not replace or modify the harness — it teaches the harness to talk to a local model instead of the Anthropic / OpenAI cloud.

## Three Layers

### 1. Machine profile + model recommendation (`poc_bridge.py`)

- `profile` — dumps a JSON snapshot of installed harnesses, engines, `llmfit`, and free disk
- `recommend` — picks the best-fit installed coding model for the hardware
- `doctor` — pretty-prints the current wizard state and re-runs presence checks

### 2. Interactive setup wizard (`wizard.py`)

A 9-step wizard that runs once (or with `--resume` after a failure):

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Discover installed harnesses and engines |
| 2 | Report missing tools and installation hints |
| 3 | Ask which harness + engine to use |
| 4 | Ask which model (or auto-pick via `llmfit`) |
| 5 | Smoke-test the engine with the chosen model |
| 6 | Wire up the harness |
| 7 | Install helper script + shell aliases (`cc` / `cx`) |
| 8 | End-to-end verification |
| 9 | Generate personalized `guide.md` |

State is persisted to `.claude-codex-local/wizard-state.json` so a failed run can be resumed without starting over.

### 3. Helper scripts + shell aliases

The user-facing surface after setup:

- `.claude-codex-local/bin/cc` (or `cx`) — a short bash wrapper that invokes the configured launch command
- `~/.zshrc` / `~/.bashrc` — one fenced block per harness (`# >>> claude-codex-local:claude >>>` … `# <<< claude-codex-local:claude <<<` for the Claude harness, `# >>> claude-codex-local:codex >>>` … `# <<< claude-codex-local:codex <<<` for Codex); each block is idempotently replaced on re-run of its own harness, and the two blocks coexist so `cc` and `cx` can both be installed at once. A one-shot migration rewraps any legacy (pre-#16) unified block into the per-harness format.

## Engine Strategies

### Ollama (primary)

Uses `ollama launch claude --model <tag>`, an official Ollama subcommand that:

- Sets the right env vars internally
- Execs the user's real `claude` binary against the local Ollama daemon
- Preserves `~/.claude` exactly as-is — skills, agents, MCP servers all work

### LM Studio / llama.cpp (secondary)

Uses an inline-env approach: the helper script exports `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and related vars, then execs the harness. This works because both Claude Code and Codex CLI support OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

## Isolation Rule

**The wizard never writes to `~/.claude` or `~/.codex`.**

All state is isolated under `.claude-codex-local/` (or `$CLAUDE_CODEX_LOCAL_STATE_DIR`). The user's global config is always used read-only.

## Rollback

Remove the alias block from `~/.zshrc` / `~/.bashrc` and delete `.claude-codex-local/`. The original `claude` / `codex` commands are unaffected.
