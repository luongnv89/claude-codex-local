# Validation: Local Claude/Codex Fallback

## Quick Verdict
**Build it**

## Why

This is a real painkiller if positioned correctly. Many Claude Code and Codex users hit quota, rate, network, or privacy constraints and would love a local backend mode that picks a reasonable coding model automatically.

The idea becomes much stronger when the user does **not** have to change how they use Claude Code or Codex. It becomes weak only if it pretends to be a full offline replacement. As a local backend bridge, it is honest, useful, and MVP-able.

## Similar Products

Direct/adjacent references:
- Ollama itself
- LM Studio
- llama.cpp
- local model launchers/wrappers
- OpenCode / local coding-agent tooling
- generic model routers and local LLM managers

But most of these are not focused on the specific promise:
- detect local runtime
- choose a coding-capable model for *this* machine
- configure sane defaults automatically
- preserve official Claude/Codex setup
- provide an easy "go local / go back" workflow

## Differentiation

The differentiation is not raw inference.
It is the **fallback workflow** and **configuration intelligence**.

Key differentiators:
- `llmfit`-driven best-fit model selection
- coding-focused runtime/model choice rather than generic chat setup
- explicit support for users of official Claude Code and Codex workflows
- safe separation from official Anthropic/OpenAI configuration
- product names can map cleanly to **`claude-local`** and **`codex-local`**
- one-command switch to local and one-command switch back
- minimal or zero workflow change for the end user

## Strengths
- solves a real, recurring pain point
- narrow enough to explain clearly if framed as fallback, not replacement
- strong CLI wedge
- good fit for power users and local-LLM tinkerers
- `llmfit` gives the idea a concrete engine instead of hand-wavy “smart selection” marketing

## Concerns
- local coding quality can still disappoint on weaker machines
- runtime normalization across Ollama, LM Studio, and llama.cpp is messy
- users may still expect parity with Claude Code/Codex if naming is sloppy
- the best model for coding is not only about tokens/sec; tool behavior matters a lot
- model download UX can become bloated if too many options are exposed

## Ratings
- Creativity: 7/10
- Feasibility: 8/10
- Market Impact: 7/10
- Technical Execution: 8/10

## How to Strengthen

1. **Nail the positioning**
   - call it a fallback/orchestration layer
   - avoid implying full Claude Code parity

2. **Be opinionated on recommendations**
   - pick one best-fit model per machine/profile instead of showing a giant menu
   - default mode should be `balanced`

3. **Keep Anthropic/OpenAI setups untouched**
   - store config in your own namespace
   - make switching explicit and reversible

4. **Start with only 3 runtimes**
   - Ollama
   - LM Studio
   - llama.cpp
   - add vLLM later if needed

5. **Optimize for coding, not generic chat**
   - low temperature defaults
   - context and timeout tuning
   - benchmark/tooling checks aimed at code tasks

## Enhanced Version

A CLI product that acts as a **local backend bridge for cloud coding agents**.

Naming direction:
- `claude-local`
- `codex-local`

Example flow:
1. user keeps using Claude Code or Codex in the normal way
2. local backend mode is configured once
3. tool detects Ollama / LM Studio / llama.cpp
4. tool profiles the machine
5. tool uses `llmfit` to score available models
6. tool either:
   - auto-selects the best installed coding model, or
   - recommends one download with a single clear suggestion
7. user can run with the local backend path without learning a new workflow
8. later, user can return to official cloud workflow instantly

Future extension:
- support both Claude-oriented and Codex-oriented local backend modes
- add a doctor command to explain missing runtime/model issues
- add lightweight coding-benchmark sanity checks for installed models

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1 — MVP
- support Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp detection
- collect hardware/machine profile
- integrate `llmfit` for best-fit model scoring
- define three user modes: balanced / fast / quality
- implement separate local config storage
- provide setup, status, and run commands

### Phase 2 — Better fallback UX
- add explicit official/local switching commands
- recommend one best model download when no fit model is installed
- cache the last-known-good local config
- improve error handling and doctor diagnostics

### Phase 3 — Product polish
- support Codex-oriented launch mode explicitly
- add optional lightweight benchmark/profile validation
- expand runtime support if justified (e.g. vLLM)
- explore editor integrations and richer coding-tool behavior

## Bottom Line

This is worth building **if the message is honest**:
not “offline Claude Code”, but **“Claude Code / Codex with a local backend when cloud quotas or connectivity fail.”**

That is a clean promise, a real problem, and a feasible first product.
